Welcome to the Refugee Hotspot Admin Setup.

This is probably the first time you're running this device. So we
would like to help you set this up. 

The Refugee Hotspot is aimed at providing Internet connections to
migrants and refugees by using a 3G connection and turning it into a
wireless network that people can access. 

Note: This setup is meant for people who will administer a Refugee
Hotspot.  This means you will need to have at least a basic
understanding of networking and Debian or similar GNU/Linux systems. 

There are eight short steps for this, which should not take you more
than 10 minutes.

Let's get this set up.

You need the following:

* Your public SSH key
* A VPN certificate (.ovpn file)

Make sure that you have either copied these onto this flash card or
have a USB plugged in with these files on it.

If you have no idea what we're talking about, just continue.

    print("""1. Remote Access (SSH Login)

You might want to remotely administer this device so you can check
whether it works without having to be physically connected to it.
Remote access is provided via a Tor Hidden Service. 

To be able to get remote access to this device you will need to add
your public SSH key to the file:

     /home/nomad/.ssh/authorized_keys

There are two approaches to this: 

    Approach 1
    ----------
    Put the SD card into your computer and copy your public SSH key to
    $MOUNT/home/nomad/.ssh/authorized_keys, where $MOUNT is the
    directory you have mounted the SD card.

    Approach 2
    ----------
    Put an USB flash drive with the public SSH key on it into the
    Raspberry Pi and copy the SSH key to
    /home/nomad/.ssh/authorized_keys (you might need to mount the USB
    flash drive first). 

(Note that you will need to do a similar thing with the VPN setup,
so if you want to do that then read the next step before starting.)
 
If you don't know what an SSH key is, let alone how to generate it,
you might want to search on the Internet, or read the ssh man page
(via "man ssh"), or not use remote administatration at all. :)

This is the Tor Hidden Service address to which you can connect:

administration e-mail on boot, if you set this up.

This device works without a VPN connection, but it works better and is
more stable with a VPN connection. A VPN also protects your users from
several kinds of mass surveillance. 

Therefore it is recommended that you purchase you own VPN certificate,
for instance from AirVPN: https://airvpn.org. Alternatively you can
use a VPN certificate provided by us, with no guarantee that it will
keep working. 

To configure the VPN copy the .ovpn file to:

     /etc/openvpn/hotspot.conf

There are two approaches to this: 

    Approach 1
    ----------
    Put the SD card into your computer and copy your public .ovpn file
    to $MOUNT/etc/openvpn/hotspot.conf where $MOUNT is the directory
    you have mounted the SD card.

    Approach 2
    ----------
    Put an USB flash drive with the public OPVN file on it into the
    Raspberry Pi and copy the .ovpn file to /etc/openvpn/hotspot.conf
